      <p>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real-life bears of this world are proud, independent
        creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV.
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed
        vision? In this article we try to answer those questions and give you a real insight into the
        life of the bear.
      </p>

      <h3 class="fancy">Types of bear</h3>
      <p>
        Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don’t get small bears. If you have seen a
        small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as
        at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different
        behaviour however, as you’ll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts
        about bears.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fancy" id="gallery">Majestic bears in their element</h2>
      <p>
        Bears are powerful and adaptable, thriving everywhere from icy coasts to deep forests. Thick fur,
        keen noses and serious fishing skills help them survive; curiosity and playfulness make them a joy
        to watch (from a very safe distance).
      </p>
      <p>
        The photographs below capture two sides of bear life. First, a wild brown bear working a river for
        dinner; then an “urban” bear making do in a human landscape. Together they show how easily bears
        switch between wilderness and the edges of our towns.

      <h3 class="fancy">Mating rituals</h3>
      <p>
        Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate they can spend the rest
        of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — 
        for example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting
        and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban bear.
      </p>

        The following audio clip contains a fact file providing more details about bear mating rituals,
        along with samples and quotes from experts.

          Welcome to All About Bears, your guide to one of nature’s most fascinating yet misunderstood animals. While films often portray them as fearsome brutes, bears are intelligent, adaptable, and attuned to their surroundings. They roam remote wilderness or the edges of cities, showing remarkable flexibility in how they live. Large or medium in size, wild bears may grow over two meters, live up to 28 years, and thrive on fish, meat, and plants. Urban bears, in our playful imagining, might stroll in “North Face” gear past coffee shops, living longer, sometimes to 32 years, by learning to seek human food. In the wild, they detect scents kilometres away, spot fish with precision, and catch them in a single swipe; near people, they may raid picnics or bins. Even courtship ranges from strength displays in the wild to, humorously, mood lighting and a Michael Bublé playlist. Whether deep in forests or at city edges, bears remain resourceful survivors and vital to the ecosystems they call home.

        <p>
          Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really "into" wildlife since
          childhood. He once went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
          He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound
          cool.
