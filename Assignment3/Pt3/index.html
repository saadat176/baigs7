    <h2>Brave new world</h2>
    <p>
      It's a brave new world out there. Our children are being put in increasing
      more competitive situations, both during recreation, and as they start to
      move into the adult world of
      <a href="http://example.com/examination">examinations</a>,
      <a href="http://example.com/jobs">job careers</a>, and other life choices.
      Having the wrong mindset, becoming
      <a href="http://example.com/too_emotional">too emotional</a>, or making the
      wrong choices can contribute to them experiencing difficulty in taking
      their rightful place in today's ideal society.
    </p>
    <p>
      As concerned parents, guardians or carers, you will no doubt want to give
      your children the best possible start in life â€” and you've come to the
      right place.

    <h2>The best start in life</h2>
    <p>
      At St. Huxley's, we pride ourselves in not only giving our students a top
      quality education, but also giving them the societal and emotional
      intelligence they need to win big in the coming utopia. We not only excel at
      subjects such as genetics, data mining, and chemistry, but we also include
      compulsory lessons in:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Emotional control</li>
      <li>Judgement</li>
      <li>Assertion</li>
      <li>Focus and resolve</li>
    </ul>
